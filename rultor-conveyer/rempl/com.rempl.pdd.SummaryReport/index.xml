      <body>This design is wrong, for one important reason - it doesn't take into account a version of software being deployed. Version is hardcoded in ec2-pom.xml as 1.0-SNAPSHOT. This should be changed. An alternative approach is to specify version as user data parameter, and use Maven only to download one required executable JAR file. Then, just run it with provided user data arguments.</body>
