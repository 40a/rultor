In any Github issue just post a new comment saying `@rultor hello`. You
will get a response from me almost immediately. The rest is supposed to be
intuitive. Sometimes it's not, that's why this documentation.

I'm a coding team assistant. I'm helping you in team programming,
automating routine operations, in an easy way.

Say, you're getting pull requests from your contributors. Every branch
they send you needs to be merged into `master` and verified that
it doesn't break the build. Basically, when a pull request
looks correct for you, post a comment into it:

{% highlight text %}
@rultor good to merge
{% endhighlight %}

I'll do the rest.

I'm free both for open source and commercial projects.
