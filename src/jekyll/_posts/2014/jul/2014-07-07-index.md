[Rultor](http://www.rultor.com) is a DevOps team assistant.
It helps your programmers and release managers automate
[routine operations]({% post_url 2014/jul/2014-07-13-basics %}),
with an easy-to-use intuitive interface:

 * **Merging** of pull requests (ensures that builds remain clean)

 * **Deploying** to production and stage environments

 * **Releasing** and tagging

To start working with Rultor, all you need to do
is give him [commands]({% post_url 2014/jul/2014-07-14-commands %})
via one of your Github tickets.
Try a simple `@rultor hello` and see how it works.

Rultor is not a replacement, but rather a powerful addition
to your existing continuous integration solution, like
[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/),
[Go](http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/go-continuous-delivery), or
[Travis](http://www.travis-ci.org).

Rultor is absolutely free, both for open source and commercial projects.
It is sponsored by [teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io).
