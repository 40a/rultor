[Rultor](http://www.rultor.com)
is a coding team assistant. It is helping your programming team
to automate [routine operations]({% post_url 2014/jul/2014-07-13-basics %}),
in an easy way:

 * **Merging** of pull requests (ensuring build remains clean)

 * **Deploying** to production and stage environments

 * **Releasing** and tagging

All you need to do, in order to start working with Rultor,
is to give him commands in one of your Github tickets.
Try a simple `@rultor hello` and see how it works.

Rultor is not a replacement but a powerful addition
to your existing continuous integration solution, like
[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/),
[Go](http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/go-continuous-delivery), or
[Travis](http://www.travis-ci.org).

Rultor is absolutely free, both for open source and commercial projects.
It is sponsored by [teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io).

Yeah, BTW, every build runs in its own
[Docker]({% post_url 2014/jul/2014-07-13-docker %})
container! :)
