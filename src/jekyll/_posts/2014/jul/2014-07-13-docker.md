Rultor runs every build in its own [Docker](http://www.docker.io) container.
This approach has multiple benefits.

First of all, you can easily reproduce errors Rultor is reporting,
in your own machine. Just install Docker, start a container from
`yegor256/rultor` image, and run your build inside it. You will get
exactly the same output as you see in Rultor logs.

This is how you start a container, BTW:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo docker run -i -t yegor256/rultor /bin/bash
{% endhighlight %}

Second, usage of Docker containers make possible to make
complex builds much faster. When your build requires a lot of
heavy weight prerequisites (for example apt-get packages or Maven
dependencies), you don't have to wait for them on every build.

Instead, create your own Docker image, install everything in it,
and publish it to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

Then, configure your [`.rultor.yml`]({% post_url 2014/jul/2014-07-13-reference %})
to use your own Docker image, and enjoy fast builds.
