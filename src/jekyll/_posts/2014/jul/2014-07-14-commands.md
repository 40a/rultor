  Here is a full list of Rultor commands
---

All commands you give to Rultor should start
with `@rultor` and be followed by a text, which includes a mnemo of a command.
For example, in order to check the status of Rultor in current
conversation (ticket), you can post a comment:

{% highlight text %}
@rultor what is the current status?
{% endhighlight %}

The mnemo of the command here is `status`. All the rest is ignored.
You can achieve exactly the same by just posting:

{% highlight text %}
@rultor status
{% endhighlight %}

Here is a full list of all commands, in alphabetic order.

BTW, all commands are configured through
[.rultor.yml]({% post_url 2014/jul/2014-07-13-reference %}).

## Deploy

Deploying packaged product to production (or test) environment, in order
to make it available for end-users (or testers).
More details are [here]({% post_url 2014/jul/2014-07-13-basics %}).

## Hello

Sort of a "ping". Post `@rultor hello` and expect an immediate answer
from Rultor (well, within 60 seconds). If you don't get an answer, there
is something wrong with Rultor. Feel free to post a bug to our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/yegor256/rultor/issues).

post `@rultor status` and see what Rultor says.
